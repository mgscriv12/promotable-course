/* Hypothesis / predictions:

- I believe the majority of my outgoing funds were for Rent, followed by Groceries, and shopping. 
Due to some large auto payments (down payment / pay-off), itâ€™s possible that may have surpassed one or both of these categories.
- The majority of outgoing funds came directly out of my main checking account. After this, my main account used was 
my Citi Costco card.
- The majority of income was from PayPal, followed by etrade / stock sales.
- Income increased from 2016 to 2017
