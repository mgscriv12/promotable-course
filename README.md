/* Hypothesis / predictions:

- I believe the majority of my outgoing funds were for Rent, followed by Groceries, and shopping. Due to some large auto payments (down payment / pay-off), itâ€™s possible that may have surpassed one or both of these categories.
- The majority of outgoing funds came directly out of my main checking account. After this, my main account used was my Citi Costco card.
- The majority of income was from PayPal, followed by etrade / stock sales.
- Income increased from 2016 to 2017

/* As expected, Mortgage & Rent was the highest at 26k
I thought Groceries would be second, but Auto & Transport was 14.7k

payment and paying off a loan when selling vehicle.

I searched for only those which contained "paypal", the second query

To give more insight into comparing the two, I have broken each year down by the credit category. The categories normally found in debits (Travel, Rideshare, Shopping) are due to refunds received (credits) on debits in those categories */

/* This gives a little better insight into my total credits and it's easier to see how / why the credits are higher in 2017, as well as each value's portion of the total credits. Income (mostly paychecks) was actually lower, but the stock sales and taxes were both significantly higher which helped to offset. */
