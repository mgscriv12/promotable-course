#1.	Load the python libraries - Done (Data pulled is only for top 200 for 2012)
#2.	Create dummy variables and account for missing data - created a dummy variable and appended to my dataframe. Also 
#3.	Describe your data - Done
#4.	Which of our variables are potentially collinear? - After reviewing correlation, it is clear that a few of my 
#datapoints are collinear, especially since a few of them relate specifically to each other. The total score would
#naturally relate to the world rank, and teaching/research also tie into the world rank and total score closely 
#international_students and international would also be collinear
#5.	Create an exploratory analysis plan of your data - Will use various charting options to look further at data
#6.	What is your hypothesis? - My hypothesis is that number of students will have no impact on a school's rank
#I also think that the larger a school, the higher their student / staff ratio will be 
#7.	Bonus: Test your hypothesis with Logistic Regression

# As expected, there is a large impact on the world_rank variability, 87% specifically, that can be attributed to these
# 4 variables. This indicates that if you have a way to measure these four scores, you have a good chance of being able
# to predict the school's world rank.

# the min for each of my columns checked is in the teens or low 20s, so let's shoot for a prediction that doesn't
# already fall within our dataset, how about a very poorly ranked school?
lm.predict([[1,1,1,1]])
# this predicts the school will be ranked 310, which is pretty bad considering we're looking specifically at the top 200
# we should keep in mind that the scores are unlikely to scale that steeply when moving past the top 200
